      <p>A Little History of the World Wide Web</p>

          Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document
          called “Information Management: A Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s
          initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss at
          the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but exciting” on the
          cover.

          Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the
          foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts
          of your web browser):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language
            for the web.
          </li>
          <li>
            URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique
            and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also
            commonly called a URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of
            linked resources from across the web.
          </li>
        </ul>
